# sentiment-prediction-with-nn-and-naive-bayes

Welcome to my kernel sentiment analysis on The Rotten Tomatoes movie review.

As this is my first time working on sentiment analysis problem, i will try to go through some basic process like tokenizing, stemming, lemmatizing, wordclouds, get rid of stop words and so on, also i will try to predict the sentiment in test set, train set and the combination of the train and test set

we will go through these topics:

    1- Text Preprocessing
    2- Word Clouds
    3- Predicting sentiment for test data Using NN
    4- Predicting sentiment for overall set with Naive bayes and NN
